TU-Delft-huisstijl
==================
Imrovements on the TU Delft style template of which the original can be found on:
http://www.ewi.tudelft.nl/en/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics/latex/beamer/
This version forks 'Template_Beamer_TUhuisstijl_eenvoudig.tex'

Differences between this template and the original one
------------------
- Compatible with at least Miktex(on Windows) and Texlive(on Linux/Mac) LaTeX distributions.
- Smaller file size of the generated pdf. This improves loading speed and makes navigation faster for some pdf readers.
- No control bar by default (but can be enabled)
