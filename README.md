==================
Imrovements on the TU Delft style template of which the original can be found on:

Differences between this template and the original one
------------------
- Compatible with at least Miktex(on Windows) and Texlive(on Linux/Mac) LaTeX distributions.
- File size of (empty) presentation is 81KB. The file size of the original version is 445KB. This improves loading speed of the pdf.
- Smaller file size of the generated pdf. This improves loading speed and makes navigation faster for some pdf readers.
- No control bar by default (but can be enabled)
